# simplegame
Project 1 idea

MVP:

The idea is to create a simple game that involves moving objects to avoid, and that the main character has to jump over.
The game will progress until you get hit by one of the objects in your way.

If there is time, I will ideally want to create a detailed background image using HTML Canvas.
